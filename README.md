# AWARE: Autism Wellness Assessment and Recognition Engine

**AWARE (Autism Wellness Assessment and Recognition Engine)** introduces a novel approach to autism detection by integrating questionnaire analysis and computer vision techniques within a web-based application. This method aims to make autism assessments more accessible and effective for both parents and professionals.

## Overview

The assessment begins with **parents completing an online questionnaire** designed to capture crucial behavioral indicators of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These questionnaires encompass a range of behavioral and psychological traits commonly associated with autism, ensuring comprehensive data collection. **Advanced machine learning algorithms** analyze the responses to identify patterns and anomalies indicative of ASD, providing a preliminary assessment that offers valuable insights for further evaluation.

## Dual-Modality Approach

1. **Questionnaire Analysis**:
   - **Machine Learning**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to assess responses, highlighting potential ASD markers.
   
2. **Computer Vision Analysis**:
   - **Webcam Interaction**: The child's interaction with an on-screen passage is monitored to capture **facial expressions** and **eye movements**.
   - **Visual Markers**: Computer vision algorithms detect subtle non-verbal cues and atypical behaviors associated with autism, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

This **dual-modality approach** integrates both self-reported and observable aspects of autism, providing a holistic view of the childâ€™s condition and a thorough, precise evaluation.

## Benefits and Future Directions

Preliminary results show that AWARE can improve diagnostic accuracy and offer insights into individual wellness profiles, supporting more personalized interventions. By making the diagnostic process accessible and efficient, AWARE facilitates **early detection and intervention**, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with autism.

Future work will focus on:
- **Expanding the dataset**
- **Refining machine learning and computer vision algorithms**
- **Exploring real-time assessment capabilities** to further enhance utility in various settings.

AWARE represents a significant advancement in AI-driven autism assessment, with the potential to transform autism diagnostics.
